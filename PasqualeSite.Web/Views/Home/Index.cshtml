                    <p>
                        My name is Pasquale, but people call me Squalls. This website is intended to be a way for you to get to know me better. It's also an outlet for me in which I
                        talk about all the things I love, whether it be development, movies, music, video games, sports, travel, etc. I hope that one day this place can be much more
                        than that, but until then, I will use this to showcase my skills and rant or rave but things that I find interesting. I hope that you find something interesting here as well,
                        and feel free to email me with any questions!

            <p>Feel free to read my latests posts (or go back in time). I write about just about anything that comes to mind. Mostly nerdy stuff, like what's going on in the world of tech, video games, etc. Or maybe I'll talk about sports.</p>

            <p>I like to hit buttons on a keyboard and make the computer do things for me. I have created some pretty cool stuff. Check out my portfolio for a quick look at what I've done. Or, if you'd prefer, continue using this site, as I built it too!</p>
